<h2>TrackR is your new workout best friend!</h2>
 🏃🏻‍♂️ This app was built with the abitily to track your current location, wherever you are, and display in on a map. Then you can choose a workout type (running, cycling or surfing) and according to your choice of workout, a list of options will be created for you to input your workout information.

🚴🏻Then simply add the workout to the map and will be saved for you whenever you enter the app, unless you want to clear the current list of workouts and create a new one!

🏄🏻‍♂️ Hope you have fun, good workouts!
